Project 3 was an interactive system based on a database of 500 items. For our project, Jennifer Lee and I chose mass shootings across the US that occurred in 2018 that go only as far back to the summer of 2017. Because this is an ongoing issue in our country, we needed to convey the frequency of these tragic events. The experience designed allows users to not only view the very large stack of events printed on pink and grey paper but to take each sheet of paper and punch holes for every victim involved. As the user finishes their desired amount of hole-punching, they can take the scraps and fill the jar. Major takeaways from this project are the visualization of frequency is shown in paper color, amount of hole-punch scraps in jar, and the remains/texture of the paper that is cut into by the hole-punch device. Since this is a very tiring process, it can make the user think why this issue is still occurring.
